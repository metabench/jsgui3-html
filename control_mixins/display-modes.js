//  so a text box could display as a small box with intro text and '...', then expand when pressed.

// Just use display.js ???? May be a more user-friendly and simple name.
//  Much of that is about modes and categories of modes.

    // setup display modes on the control
    //  could set up some intelligent default sizes...
    //   eg 'icon' size is 32x32.
    
    // May get given info about the wanted shapes for the display modes (where possible).

    // preferred_ratio perhaps?
    // preferred_shape.ratio perhaps?
    // preferred_shape.width = 100% perhaps?
    // perferred_shape.available_width = true perhaps.


    // Could have this set up display modes with default options to start with.

    // Want it to be easy to call on and use display mode functionality.
    //  May want nice (CSS) transitions between display modes.

    // ctrl.display_mode = 'small' for example.
    // ctrl.popup_active property?
    // ctrl.display.popup ???

    // .display property?
    // .display.mode property perhaps?

    // ctrl.display seems like it could make sense for handling higher level display properties.
    //  above the CSS and DOM attributes.
