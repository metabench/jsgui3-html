const bind = (ctrl, location) => {

    // Sets position / size of ctrl relative to another / location.

    // Binds the ctrl into free space?

    // Parsing of location binding...?
    //  Could make an OO object out if it.

    // Possibly other styling / positioning functionality should be made as mixins too.

    // Binding a control to another control or distance / space will require listening for when the control size or dimensions change.
    //  Do this with requestAnimationFrame?
    //  Or responding to events in a chain that cause its resizing?
    //   ie will a control know when it's being resized / its size changes due to css?

    // Could check its size after a window resize event.
    //  That would be one time to recalculate / recalibrate sizing.

    // Bound control will likely be in a body-relative absolute layer.


    // Control being within an overlay / modal layer / background layer...
    // May need to get info about the control's parent.


    // Functional binding?

    // More work on resize events and notifications.
    //  Worth making an example / demo for this.



    // resize_events mixin?
    // dims_events mixin?

    // more in the Page_Context to do with resize events?
    //  context.on resize could happen when the window resizes.

    // https://www.npmjs.com/package/resize-observer-polyfill

    // Possibly do a little lower level framework work on repositioning and resizing.
    //  Get some things working an then reach for tools & polyfills.
