/*
    Like expandable?
      Expandable makes sense. Could use a toggle button for it too...?
      Expandable sounds like resizable.

      // State properties?

      // open_closed would make sense.
      //  each mixin having its own state? a specific state variable for each of the mixins.

      // Expansion - open closed.
      //  expansion state?
