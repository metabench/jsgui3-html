# Session Plan: Visual Editor Controls Implementation Prep

**Date**: 2026-01-29
**Goal**: Prepare to implement all visual editor controls defined in the spec.

## Scope
- In scope: create a control checklist, capture implementation prep notes, and ensure documentation continuity.
- Out of scope: implementing controls or code changes beyond session setup.

## Checklist (All Controls)
- [x] Selection_Handles
- [x] Snap_Guide_Overlay
- [x] Property_Grid
- [x] Dockable_Panel_System
- [x] Document_Tab_Container
- [x] Dialog
- [x] Color_Picker
- [x] Font_Picker
- [x] Date_Picker_Progressive
- [x] Calendar
- [x] Status_Bar
- [x] Anchor_Editor
- [x] Dock_Editor
- [x] Collection_Editor
- [x] Undo_Redo_Manager
- [x] Clipboard_Manager

## Risks
- Missing dependencies between controls (calendar/date picker, docking subcontrols).
- Underestimating time for MVVM binding integration and activation.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Session folder and plan created.
- [ ] Checklist includes all controls.
- [ ] SESSIONS_HUB.md updated with this session.
