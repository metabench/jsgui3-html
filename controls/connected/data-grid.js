// Will compose as div / divs rather than table.

// Fast rendering of the data.

// Gets the data in an array / arrays.
//  Sets up the grid using initial data - needs to know about axes and ranges.

// Loads additional data once set up.

// Drag-and-drop interface, rules and restrictions specified.
//  Side-view popups as well.

// Full container
//  Main window
//  Status bar - can be increased/decreased in size.
//  Menus can be designed to appear on the side.

// Looks like a Grid9 container would come in handy.
//  Could operate as a table made out of DIVs.

// div class = row
//  div class = item

// This would be useful for visualising plenty of different types of data and UI interfaces.

// Will have some kinds of bindings to the data.

// Will be useful for showing a bunch / collection of addresses
//  Can also have a Data_Filter (change List_Filter to Data_Filter?)

// Each row is a Div
// Each cell is a Div
// row_header_cell
// column_header_cell

// Possibly Grid should be expanded?
//  though Grid can do much for layout too.
