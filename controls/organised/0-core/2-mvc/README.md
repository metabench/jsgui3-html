MVC Controls:



Have .model and .view properties

Can have multiple models.

Can have multiple views.

Views are used to represent a model in the UI.

Allowed data type(s) determined by model.

.model.value
.model.on('change', e => {...})
.model.type

.view.value
.view.on('change', e=> {...})
View type? View model type? View data type?
The view represents data in the model.
It could do that with different means though.
.view.mode ???
.view.model perhaps
  such as spacing settings
