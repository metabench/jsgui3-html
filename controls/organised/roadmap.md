The controls were reorganised into categories.
May make more core / basic controls that are just for editing one piece of information?
The root component controls?

Editing a text value / string in a box? The box seems like styling. Whether it's in a text input element or not....
That would depend on the view.
  Could a view have multiple (view) modes?

A view of a textbox (single line) for simple text input.
  Then can have validation functions. Type declatation too, or some means of identifying the type?

The means of adapting or customising a control to a (more) specific type.

Will make some higher level controls more oriented around type.

Variety of string editors.
Probably not very long strings will need to be edited.
A number editor could extend a string editor.

Plan on making these MVC type Controls go into the core.
  These MVC Controls would have interchangable views.
  Possibly there would be many more files of views, perhaps a directory full of views for a single control.
Perhaps we want some really simple controls? May be the case when it's only about mapping a DOM element.
  Or maybe better have some really simple views for some controls?

MVC_String ???
