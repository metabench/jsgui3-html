May SHOWCASE some controls within the main lib

Core controls
  Basic controls
  ?Plan is to keep them there?


Standard Controls
  Don't need to be so basic.
  Do need to be kept in the system and maintained if necessary.
  Should not be all that large.

Showcase Controls
  May be quite advanced
  May be large / purpose specific
  At a future point may be abandoned, moved to its own project, or otherwise integrated.
  May become paid-only versions when removed from this open-source project
  May become a demo / limited version of a more advanced Control

  Would be nice on a 'Showcase' website, nicely named.

Much improved versions of core / standard controls could go to Showcase.
